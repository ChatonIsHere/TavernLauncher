"""
Installing the two mods that are prerequisites rather than choices:
MelonLoader, which has to load before anything else can, and TavernLib, which
is what makes a server's mod support work at all. Shared by both apps, since
both need Install/Update buttons for the same two.

Nothing else belongs here. CircuitsVoiceChat used to, as an "optional mod"
row, and its installer was a second bespoke copy of this file's
download-verify-fallback machinery pinned to one hard-coded GitHub repo. It is
a community mod now, installed through the Mod Manager like any other, which
gets it version pinning, dependency resolution, a sha256 checked against a
reviewed index, and the ability to be turned off per server -- none of which a
hard-coded installer here could offer.
